A workflow ace and wearer of many hats whose expertise is in running projects for small to large companies working alongside some of the industry's most effective CEOs. 

Tech muscles include: 

* Establishing fast (and efficient!) workflows that include integrations spanning multiple products.

* Continuous improvement - When I'm not working, you'll find me learning something new. I have just wrapped up a master's degree in Data Science. My free time is spent taking MOOC courses in machine learning, product management, agile/scrum, project management, blockchain, User Experience or participating in local technology meetups. 

* Building real, lasting relationships with clients and walking them gently (and humorously) through setting up products. 

* Deep insight on implementation of projects and collection of key performance indicators (KPIs), both as an in-house employee and as a consultant.

* Solid success working with internal and external stakeholders to define requirements and overall processes.

**Fun facts:** My dog, Banksy, is the best assistant. I'm into working out (lifting is my poison), and thrive on seeing projects that interest me move from start to finish.

Open to connections, job queries, and caffeine with people and companies that are taking names and shaking up industries.
