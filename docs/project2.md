[Code](https://github.com/danjsiegel/Portfolio/tree/master/project%202)

This project is an analysis of the survivial rate of Thoracic Surgery. The analysis includes fitting a GLM model to the data, calculating the ROC and AUC and then comparing the GLM Model to a KNN model. 

### Script Outputs

Word documents which showcase the results of my analysis of survival rates and the factors which affect them.
