# Data Wrangling with Python

[Code](https://github.com/danjsiegel/Portfolio/tree/master/project%206)

In this project, I demonstrate how to extract data from various different data sources. Rather than simply import the data into Pandas, I chose to print out the data in the format of dictionary row.  

Data Sources:
* CSV
* JSON
* PDF
* EXCEL

The objective is to just print the data as it's own dictionary row to showcase that the data has been properly extracted. 

### Requirements

Python 3.6 

#### Python Libraries
* csv
* json
* pandas
* xlrd
