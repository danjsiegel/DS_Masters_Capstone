    "For the final project, you will be combining your knowledge and work on previous assignments and lessons into a simple, but complete data science project.  \n",

    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The final project should follow the directory structure shown below.  You will be responsible for implementing each of the scripts, ensuring that they work correctly, and generating any necessary data and reports. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is an extension of the midterm project with the addition of object-oriented programming, unit testing, documentation strings, and version control.  Start with the midterm project as your starting point.  You should use the version-controlled project you created in the previous assignment as your starting point. \n",
    "\n",
    "When completed, your project should have the following structure. \n",

    "## Detailed Requirements \n",
    "\n",
    "### Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final project should be based on the midterm project and the previous assignments as a starting point.  This code from the previous assignment should be the basis for the `master` branch.  You should develop your final project in the `final-project-<username>` branch of the `master` branch.  In this case `<username>` is your username.  In most situations, this is your first initial combined with your last name.   \n",
    "\n",
    "If you desire, you can create [feature branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) off your `final-project` branch and merge them into the `final-project-<username>` branch when finished.  This is completely optional. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you are completed, you will submit `final-project-<username>` branch as a pull request.  This pull request will go through several code reviews prior to being merged into the master branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Script Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs for the processed CSV and the Markdown report are the same as described in the midterm project.  The only difference is the code used to produce these outputs will use the `Avenger` class found in `avenger.py`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### OOP\n",
    "The `avenger.py` module contains the `Avenger` class. It should implement methods for all of the fields found in the input CSV.  In addition to implementing methods for each field, implement the method `to_markdown` which generates the Markdown markup described in the midterm project. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Util Package\n",
    "\n",
    "The `util` package should contain all the utility functions needed for manipulating dates and converting values. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit tests\n",
    "\n",
    "The `run_tests.py` script should run all of the unit tests in the `tests` directory.  Here are the requirements for implementing unit tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement unit test for each method in the `Avenger` class to make sure you are returning the expected output.  Make sure to test the `to_markdown` method as well. \n",
    "* Each function in the `util` package should have one or more unit tests.  The unit tests should test both valid and invalid inputs. \n",
    "* You should not have any failing unit tests when you submit the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The final project should contain valid docstrings for all modules, classes, class methods, and functions.  Unit tests do not require docstrings. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to documentation strings, your project should contain a `README.md` file that provides a short description of the project and includes instructions on how to run each of the scripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Style\n",
    "\n",
    "Before submitting your code for code review, run the `flake8` tool against all files in the `src` directory.  You should fix any code style errors before submitting your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "The last stage of your project is having other people review your pull request using the code review functionality in Github.  Before you have anyone else review your code, review your own code.  After you have reviewed your own code,  you should request a peer/classmate review your code.  Once you have incorporated changes from your peer review, request a review from the instructor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "During the code review process, you should get clarification from your reviewer on any suggestions you think are unclear.  If you decide to reject a suggestion, respectfully explain why you decided against incorporating that change. Once you are finished with all code reviews and are satisfied with all the changes, merge the pull request into the master branch. "
